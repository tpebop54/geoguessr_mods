You can install the script by copying the contents of multimod_installer.js directly to a TamperMonkey script through your TamperMonkey browser extension.

If you want access to the full code, do the same but with multimod_v1.js. This accomplishes the same thing.

You do not need to touch gg_evt.js. This will be automatically imported by either script.
