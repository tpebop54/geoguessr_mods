You can install the script by copying the contents of multimod_installer.js directly to a TamperMonkey script through your TamperMonkey browser extension.

If you want access to the full code, do the same but with multimod_v1.js. This accomplishes the same thing, but it will not automatically stay up to date.

If it is not updating properly, you may need to go to the "Externals" tab for the TamperMonkey script and click "Update" for each of the dependencies.

You do not need to touch gg_evt.js. This will be automatically imported by either script.
