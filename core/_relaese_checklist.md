# Check manually prior to release

Debug console open for all of this!!!

## Classic Maps (Solo)

In a Opera and at least one other Chromium-based broswer: (some behavior is different in Opera specifically)

* Toggle every mode on and off. Basic check for all mods, but in at least one browser, check thoroughly.
* Check that Close/Reset/Apply buttons work.
* Check that things like GG_MAP are consistently being populated (debug right click on guessmap).
* Toggle one or more on at a time and refresh the page to make sure the settings are persistent.
* Toggle one or more on at a time and go to a new round to make sure the settings are persistent.
* Add API key and disable cheat protection, make sure relevant settings are enabled.

## Private Duel:

Between two different browsers (e.g. Opera vs. Chrome), set up a duel with an alt account (can be a free account).

* Toggle all mods in each browser
* Mix and match settings that are left on, based on what has changed since last release.

## Competitive Duel:

* Start a duel with the tool enabled, toggle one of the mods to make sure it works, and then play the duel without cheating.
