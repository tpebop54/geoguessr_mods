# Legacy Files

This directory contains legacy files that are maintained for backward compatibility but are no longer the primary approach.

## Files

- **multimod_v1.js** - Original monolithic script containing all mods in a single file

## Migration

Users of legacy files should consider migrating to the modern modular installers:

- `multimod_installer.js` (main branch)
- `multimod_installer_dev.js` (dev branch)

These provide better maintainability, debugging capabilities, and development workflow while maintaining all the same functionality.

## Support

Legacy files may receive limited updates going forward as development focuses on the modular architecture.
